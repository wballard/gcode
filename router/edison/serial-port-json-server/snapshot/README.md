serial-port-json-server
=======================
Version 1.74

A serial port JSON websocket &amp; web server that runs from the command line on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone Black, or Intel Edison that lets you communicate with your serial port from a web application. This enables web apps to be written that can communicate with your local serial device such as an Arduino, CNC controller, or any device that communicates over the serial port.

The app is written in Go. It has an embedded web server and websocket server. The server runs on the standard port of localhost:8989. You can connect to it locally with your browser to interact by visiting http://localhost:8989. The websocket is technically running at ws://localhost/ws. You can of course connect to your websocket from any other computer to bind in remotely. For example, just connect to ws://192.168.1.10/ws if you are on a remote host where 192.168.1.10 is your device's actual IP address.

The app is one executable with everything you need and is available ready-to-go for every major platform. It is a multi-threaded app that uses all of the cool techniques available in Go including extensive use of channels (threads) to create a super-responsive app.

If you are a web developer and want to write a web application that connects to somebody's local or remote serial port server, then you simply need to create a websocket connection to the localhost or remote host and you will be directly interacting with that user's serial port.

For example, if you wanted to create a Gcode Sender web app to enable people to send 3D print or milling commands from your site, this would be a perfect use case. Or if you've created an oscilloscope web app that connects to an Arduino, it would be another great use case. Finally you can write web apps that interact with a user's local hardware.

Thanks go to gary.burd.info for the websocket example in Go. Thanks also go to tarm/goserial for the serial port base implementation. Thanks go to Jarret Luft as well for the major work he did on the Grbl buffer and other bug fixes to the overall code base.

Running

How to Build
---------
Video tutorial on Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hou06bOuHc

1. Install Go (http://golang.org/doc/install)
2. If you're on a Mac, install Xcode from the Apple Store because you'll need gcc to compile the native code for a Mac. If you're on Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, or Beagle Bone you are all set.
3. Get go into your path so you can run "go" from any directory:
	On Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone Black
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
	On Windows, use the Environment Variables dialog by right-click My Computer
4. Define your GOPATH variable and create the folder to match. This is your personal working folder for all yourGo code. This is important because you will be retrieving several projects from Github and Go needs to know where to download all the files and where to build the directory structure. On my Windows computer I created a folder called C:\Users\John\go and set GOPATH=C:\Users\John\go
	On Mac
	export GOPATH=/Users/john/go
	On Linux, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone Black, Intel Edison
	export GOPATH=/home/john/go
	On Windows, use the Environment Variables dialog by right-click My Computer to create GOPATH
5. Change directory into your GOPATH
6. Type "go get github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server". This will retrieve this Github project and all dependent projects. It takes some time to run this.
7. Then change direcory into github.com\johnlauer\serial-port-json-server. 
8. Type "go build" when you're inside that directory and it will create a binary called serial-port-json-server
9. Run it by typing ./serial-port-json-server or on Windows run serial-port-json-server.exe
10. If you have a firewall on the computer running the serial-port-json-server you must allow port 8989 in the firewall.

Supported Commands
-------

Command | Example | Description
------- | ------- | -------
list    |         | Lists all available serial ports on your device
open portName baudRate [bufferAlgorithm] | open /dev/ttyACM0 115200 tinyg | Opens a serial port. The comPort should be the Name of the port inside the list response such as COM2 or /dev/ttyACM0. The baudrate should be a rate from the baudrates command or a typical baudrate such as 9600 or 115200. A bufferAlgorithm can be optionally specified such as "tinyg" (or in the future "grbl" if somebody writes it) or write your own.
sendjson {} | {"P":"COM22","Data":[{"D":"!~\n","Id":"234"},{"D":"{\"sr\":\"\"}\n","Id":"235"}]} | See Wiki page at https://github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server/wiki
send portName data | send /dev/ttyACM0 G1 X10.5 Y2 F100\n | Send your data to the serial port. Remember to send a newline in your data if your serial port expects it.
sendnobuf portName data | send COM22 {"qv":0}\n | Send your data and bypass the bufferFlowAlgorithm if you specified one.
close portName | close COM1 | Close out your serial port
bufferalgorithms | | List the available bufferAlgorithms on the server. You will get a list such as "default, tinyg"
baudrates | | List common baudrates such as 2400, 9600, 115200

FAQ
-------
- Q: There are several Node.js serial port servers. Why not write this in Node.js instead of Go?

- A: Because Go is a better solution for several reasons.
	- Easier to install on your computer. Just download and run binary. (Node requires big install)
	- It is multi-threaded which is key for a serial port websocket server (Node is single-threaded)
	- It has a tiny memory footprint using about 3MB of RAM
	- It is one clean compiled executable with no dependencies
	- It makes very efficient use of RAM with amazing garbage collection
	- It is super fast when running
	- It launches super quick
	- It is essentially C code without the pain of C code. Go has insanely amazing threading support called Channels. Node.js is single-threaded, so you can't take full advantage of the CPU's threading capabilities. Go lets you do this easily. A serial port server needs several threads. 1) Websocket thread for each connection. 2) Serial port thread for each serial device. Serial Port JSON Server allows you to bind as many serial port devices in parallel as you want. 3) A writer and reader thread for each serial port. 4) A buffering thread for each incoming message from the browser into the websocket 5) A buffering thread for messages back out from the server to the websocket to the browser. To achieve this in Node requires lots of callbacks. You also end up talking natively anyway to the serial port on each specific platform you're on, so you have to deal with the native code glued to Node.

Revisions
-------
Changes in 1.7
- sendjson now supported. Will give back onQueue, onWrite, onComplete
- Moved TinyG buffer to serial byte counting.

Changes in 1.6
- Logging is now off by default so Raspberry Pi runs cleaner. The immense amount of logging was dragging the Raspi down. Should help on BeagleBone Black as well. Makes SPJS run more efficient on powerful systems too like Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can turn on logging by issuing a -v on the command line. This fix by Jarret Luft.
- Added EOF extra checking for Linux serial ports that seem to return an EOF on a new connect and thus the port was prematurely closing. Thanks to Yiannis Mandravellos for finding the bug and fixing it.
- Added a really nice Grbl bufferAlgorithm which was written by Jarret Luft who is the creator of the Grbl workspace in ChiliPeppr.
	- The buffer counts each line of gcode being sent to Grbl up to 127 bytes and then doesn't send anymore data to Grbl until it sees an OK or ERROR response from Grbl indicating the command was processed. For each OK|ERROR the buffer decrements the counter to see how much more room is avaialble. If the next Gcode command can fit it is sent immediately in.
	- This new Grbl buffer should mirror the stream.py example code from Sonny Jeon who maintains Grbl. This Serial Port JSON Server should now be able to execute the commands faster than anything out there since it's written in Go (which is C) and is compiled and super-fast.
	- Position requests occur inside this buffer where a ? is sent every 250ms to Grbl such that you should see a position just come back on demand non-stop from Grbl. It could be possible in a future version to only queue these position reports up during actual Gcode commands being sent so that when idle there are not a ton of position updates being sent back that aren't necessary.
	- Soft resets (Ctrl-x) now wipe the buffer.
	- !~? will skip ahead of all other commands now. This is important for jogging or using ! as a quick stop of your controller since you can have 25,000 lines of gcode queued to SPJS now and of course you would want these commands to skip in front of that queue.
	- Feedhold pauses the buffer inside SPJS now.
	- Cycle resume ~ unpauses the buffer inside SPJS now.
	- When using this buffer data is sent back in a per line mode rather than as characters are received so there is more efficiency on the websocket.
	- Checks for the grbl init line indicating the arduino is ready to accept commands

Changes in 1.5
- For TinyG buffer, moved to slot counter approach. The buffer planner approach was causing G2/G3 commands to overflow the buffer because the round-trip time was too off with reading QR responses. So, moved to a 4 slot buffer approach. Jogging is still a bit rough in this approach, but that can get tweaked. The new slot approach is more like counting serial buffer queue items. SPJS sends up to 4 commands and then waits for a r:{} json response. It has intelligence to know if certain commands won't get a response like !~% or newlines, so it doesn't look for slot responses and just blindly sends. The only danger is if there are 4 really long lines of Gcode that surpass the 254 bytes in the serial buffer then we could overflow. Could add trapping for that.

Changes in 1.4
- Added reporting on Queuing so you know what the state of the Serial Port JSON Server Queue is doing. The reason for this is to ensure your serial port commands don't get out of order you will want to make sure you write to the websocket and then wait for the {"Cmd":"Queued"} response. Then write your next command. This is necessary because when sending different frames across a websocket over the Internet, you can get packet retransmissions, and although you'll never lose your data, your serial commands could arrive at the server out of order. By watching that your command is queued, you are safe to send the next command. However, this can also slow things down, so now you can simply gang up multiple commands into one send and the Serial Port JSON Server will split them into separate sub-commands and tell you that it did in the queue and write reports.
	- For example, a typical queue report looks like {"Cmd":"Queued","QCnt":61,"Type":["Buf"],"D":["{\"sr\":\"\"}\n"],"Port":"COM22"}. 
	- If you send something like: send COM22 {"sr":""}\n{"qr":""}\n{"sr":""}\n{"qr":""}\n. You will get back a queue report like {"Cmd":"Queued","QCnt":4,"Type":["Buf","Buf","Buf","Buf"],"D":["{\"sr\":\"\"}\n","{\"qr\":\"\"}\n","{\"sr\":\"\"}\n","{\"qr\":\"\"}\n"],"Port":"COM22"}
	- When two queue items are written to the serial port you will get back something like {"Cmd":"Write","QCnt":1,"D":"{\"qr\":\"\"}\n","Port":"COM22"}{"Cmd":"Write","QCnt":0,"D":"{\"sr\":\"\"}\n","Port":"COM22"}
- Fixed analysis of incoming serial data due to some serial ports sending fragmented data.
- Added bufferalgorithms and baudrates commands
- A new command called sendnobuf was added so you can bypass the bufferflow algorithm. This command only is worth using if you specified a bufflerFlowAlgorithm when you opened the serial port. You use it by sending "sendnobuf com4 G0 X0 Y0" and it will jump ahead of the queue and go diretly to the serial port without hesitation.
- TinyG Bufferflow algorithm. 
	- Looks for qr responses and if they are too low on the planner buffer will trigger a pause on send. 
	- Looks for qr responses and if they are high enough to send again the bufferflow is unblocked.
	- If you pause with ! then the bufferflow also pauses.
	- If you resume with ~ then the bufferflow also resumes.
	- If you wipe the buffer with % then the bufferflow also wipes.
	- When you send !~% it automatically is sent to TinyG without buffering so it essentially skips ahead of all other buffered commands. This mimics what TinyG does internally.
	- If you ask qr reports to be turned off with a $qv=0 or {"qv":0} then bypassmode is entered whereby no blocking occurs on sending serial port commands.
	- If you ask qr reports to be turned back on with $qv=1 (or 2 or 3) or {"qv":1} (or 2 or 3) then bypassmode is turned off.
	- If a qr reponse is seen from TinyG then BypassMode is turned off automatically.

Changes in 1.3
- Added ability for buffer flow plugins. There is a new buffer flow plugin 
  for TinyG that watches the {"qr":NN} response. When it sees the qr value
  go below 12 it pauses its own sending and queues up whatever is still coming
  in on the Websocket. This is fine because we've got plenty of RAM on the 
  websocket server. The {"qr":NN} value is still sent back on the websocket as
  soon as it was before, so the host application should see no real difference
  as to how it worked before. The difference now though is that the serial sending
  knows to check if sending is paused to the serial port and queue. This makes
  sure no buffer overflows ever occur. The reason this was becoming important is
  that the lag time between the qr response and the sending of Gcode was too distant
  and this buffer flow needs resolution around 5ms. Normal latency on the Internet
  is like 20ms to 200ms, so it just wasn't fast enough. If the Javascript hosting
  the websocket was busy processing other events, then this lag time became even 
  worse. So, now the Serial Port JSON Server simply helps out by lots of extra
  buffering. Go ahead and pound it even harder with more serial commands and see 
  it fly.

Changes in 1.2
- Added better error handling
- Removed forcibly adding a newline to the serial data being sent to the port. This
  means apps must send in a newline if the serial port expects it.
- Embedded the home.html file inside the binary so there is no longer a dependency
  on an external file.
- TODO: Closing a port on Beagle Bone seems to hang. Only solution now is to kill
  the process and restart.
- TODO: Mac implementation seems to have trouble on writing data after a while. Mac
  gray screen of death can appear. Mac version uses CGO, so it is in unsafe mode.
  May have to rework Mac serial port to use pure golang code.
